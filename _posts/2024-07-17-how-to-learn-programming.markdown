In the bustling corridors of a university, I recently encountered a sobering truth that left me both saddened and reflective.
A student, having just passed a programming course, was unable to articulate or effectively use the most basic programming concepts.
This moment was a stark reminder of a significant gap in our educational approach to programming—a subject that should be as vibrant and dynamic as the technology it aims to master.

### The Problem with Syntax-First Teaching

Traditional programming education often emphasizes syntax—the specific commands and sequences needed to execute a program in a particular language.
While understanding syntax is undeniably important, focusing solely on this aspect can lead to a shallow understanding of what programming truly involves.
Syntax varies widely across different programming languages; for example, a loop in C++ might be written as `for (i=0; i < 5; i++)`, whereas in Python, it appears as `for i in range(5)`.
Despite the syntactical differences, both lines of code perform the same fundamental function: they repeat an action five times. The essence of programming lies not in the memorization of such syntax, but in grasping these underlying principles and knowing how to apply them across various scenarios and languages.

### A Broader Vision for Programming Education

Programming should be taught as a concept, a way of thinking and solving problems using computers as tools. This approach not only makes the subject more accessible but also more adaptable to the rapid changes in technology that are characteristic of our times. By teaching students to "think like a programmer" rather than to "write code in a specific language," educators can cultivate versatile problem solvers who can navigate any programming language with relative ease.

### Maybe a Solution: A New Course for a New Era

Recognizing the need for a change, I have designed a 12-session course aimed at redefining how programming is taught. This course isn't just about writing code; it's about understanding what happens when you do. It starts with the fundamental concepts of programming, gradually integrating syntax and practical assignments that reinforce these concepts. As the course progresses, it delves into advanced topics such as error handling, with the final sessions dedicated to writing clean code and exploring design patterns.

If you have a passion for programming and a desire to learn beyond the surface, I invite you to join me on this journey. Together, we can transform the way programming is taught and learned, empowering a new generation of programmers to think critically, solve problems creatively, and thrive in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

### The Future: An Open, Online Resource

My vision extends beyond the classroom. I am currently working on transforming this course into an online, freely accessible book—akin to a wiki—where anyone, anywhere, can learn to program thoughtfully and effectively. This resource will not only provide lessons and exercises but also foster a community where learners can discuss, collaborate, and grow together.

The true power of programming comes from understanding its core principles and being able to think critically about how to apply them. By shifting our educational focus from mere syntax to a more comprehensive view of what programming entails, we can empower more individuals to not just pass courses, but to truly excel as programmers.
