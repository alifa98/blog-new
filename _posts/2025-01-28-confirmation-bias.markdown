Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that affects the way we interpret information and make decisions. It refers to **the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information that confirms our preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.** This bias can lead to errors in judgment and decision-making, as it can prevent us from considering alternative viewpoints or evidence that contradicts our beliefs. This can happen in various contexts, such as research, politics, and everyday life.

I was just reading about this congtive bias and I thought it would be interesting to share it with you. I will write more about these biases in the futuer, although I know that there are tons of articles and books about them. But I think writing about something helps me to internalize the concept and understand it better.

There is a list of cognitive biases on [Wikipedia (List of Cofnitive Biases)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) that you can check out. It is a great resource for learning about the different types of biases that can affect our thinking and decision-making processes. It is not a thing that you can read once and remember all of them, but it is a good starting point to be aware of them and sometimes catch yourself when you are falling into one of these traps.

Confirmation bias can manifest in various ways in research, affecting the design, interpretation, and reporting of studies. I guess one thing that can help us here is designing a good control group experiment and being open to alternative hypotheses. It is also important to critically evaluate the evidence and consider the limitations of the data before drawing conclusions.

Finally, I guess not only we should consider this bias in our research and papers, but also in reading other's papers and research. It is important to critically evaluate the evidence and consider alternative viewpoints to avoid falling into the trap of confirmation bias.

BTW, there is a great book you may have heard, "[The Art of Thinking Clearly](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+art+of+thinking+clearly)" by Rolf Dobelli that I highly recommend. It is a great book that covers many cognitive biases and logical fallacies that we encounter in our daily lives. It is a great read for anyone interested in improving their critical thinking skills and decision-making abilities.
