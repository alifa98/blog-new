I am excited to launch **H3xplorer**, an online tool for creating and exploring hexagonal maps using Uber’s H3 system. Designed for data scientists, urban planners, and geospatial enthusiasts, H3xplorer transforms raw geographic data into hexagon grids, making it easier to visualize patterns, density, and flows.

## Why Use Hexagons?

Hexagons are ideal for geospatial analysis. Unlike squares, they minimize distortion and overlap smoothly, allowing for precise, even coverage. This structure reduces data sparsity, enhances compatibility with machine learning models, and provides richer insights through customizable resolution levels.

## Key Features of H3xplorer:

- **Interactive Map Editing**: Add and color hexagons by clicking directly on the map or entering hex IDs.
- **Customization**: Adjust each hexagon’s color, label, and opacity for clear data visualization.
- **Layer Control**: Easily switch between map styles and control opacity to suit your analysis needs.
