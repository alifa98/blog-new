So I tried something different.

I asked **Gemini** to go through the full list of ICML 2025 papers, titles and provided with the link to the paper, and pick **50 that seem especially promising**. The selection favors papers with conceptual novelty, foundational depth, and related to Foundation models, interpretability, or generative models.

Did I get it right? Maybe. Maybe not. That's part of the experiment. Maybe a different prompting can lead to a totally different list.

## How This List Was Made

This is not a leaderboard or a citation-based ranking. I wasn't given metrics, reviews, or author prestige. Just the raw metadata from ICML 2025, titles, and links.

But ultimately, **this is a speculative curation**. I haven't read the full texts (and neither have most people, because they were just released). The goal is to surface ideas that seem worth deeper attention, not to declare winners.

## Why Use AI to Curate?

Because even experts can't read everything, and sometimes it helps to bring a fresh (or weird) lens.
You might disagree with some of the picks. That's great. Use this list as a *conversation starter*, not a verdict. What would your top 10 look like? Which of these would *you* bet on becoming influential a year from now?

## ðŸ¤· So... Which One Should You Read?

Honestly? I don't know yet. That's the point.
Some of these may be overhyped. Others might be quiet classics. But all of them *seem* to reach beyond the incremental. As the full papers come out and people dig into the math, we'll see which ones hold up, and which ones quietly change the way we think.
In general, one good heuristic is always to look into papers that you **know their author/lab** that are well-known researchers, which we haven't done here. You can also follow your favourite researcher to see their tweets about their paper ðŸ˜‰. But I think this list is a good starting point to find some hidden gems.

## ðŸ§­ What's Next?

I'd love to do follow-ups:

* A deep dive into the **most cited** vs. **least cited** of these picks in six months
* A themed breakdown: *top picks in interpretability*, *causality*, *generative models*, etc.
* A comparison between **Gemini-selected vs. community-selected** papers
But for now, here's the bet: **At least a few of these 50 will turn out to matter more than their titles suggest.**

## My thought

I don't know which of these papers are truly important, or not. But the fact that Gemini selected them shows one thing clearly: it's judging based only on titles. So if we build research agents (or LLM-based search engines), they might prefer such papers, and that could lead to them being cited more frequently. (You get the idea.)
So I'm not even sure that citation count is a reliable metric for comparison later on. Anyway, thatâ€™s my final note.
If you find one you love, or one you hate, drop me a note.

This Disclaimer is clear but I have to put it anyways.

<div style="border-left: 4px solid rgb(232, 38, 125); padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9; margin: 20px 0;">
  <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This list is not endorsed by Gemini team or Google. It is a generated result of a prompt by Gemini 2.5 Pro.
</div>

## A Surprise at the end

The papers without links are the ones I couldn't find in the official ICML 2025 listings. I even searched for a few of them, turns out, they're not real papers at all.
Just hallucinations or clever mashups of existing research and academic-sounding phrases.

So hey, pick a title and write your own paper, Gemini might just love it. ðŸ˜‚

PS: My Prompt was:

~~~plain
You are an expert machine learning researcher and assistant. Your task is to select the 50 most relevant papers from the ICML 2025 conference, based on a provided list of paper titles and relative URLs (e.g., "/virtual/2025/poster/44561").

Each item is an HTML list entry:
<li><a href="/virtual/2025/poster/44561">Strategy Coopetition Explains the Emergence and Transience of In-Context Learning</a></li>

### My goals:
- Select 50 papers from ~3000 entries
- Prioritize high-quality, novel, and relevant research
- Iâ€™m particularly interested in the following topics: Foundation models, interpretability, generative models.
- Papers should be:
  - Innovative or influential
  - Related to the above topics or clearly high-impact
  - Either theoretically foundational or practically useful

### What you should do:
1. **Extract** the paper title and full URL (prepend "https://icml.cc" to the relative URL)
2. **Visit each paperâ€™s ICML page**, if accessible, and extract:
   - The abstract
   - Authors
   - Any listed keywords or presentation format (e.g., spotlight/oral)
3. **Score each paper** based on:
   - Relevance to the topics I care about
   - Novelty and clarity of the abstract
   - Expected impact (e.g., new benchmarks, theory, or trends)
4. **Select the top 50 papers**
5. **Output** your result in the following format:
```

1. [Paper Title](https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/44561)

   * Abstract summary (1â€“2 lines)
   * Reason for inclusion (e.g., topic fit, novelty, etc.)

```

Only output the final selected list of 50 papers â€” do not explain your methodology unless asked.

I am attaching the list of papers in a .txt file, read all of the papers from that.
