Hi,

My name is [Ali Faraji](https://faraji.info/).

I am a machine learning enthusiast and an open-source fan. I'm also into mathematics.

### Goals for 2025

- Defend my Master's thesis
- Contribute more to open-source projects
- Achieve at least a C1 level in French
- Learn a new programming language for fun
  - I'm thinking about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Write more blog posts‚Äîspecifically, sharing my ideas and experiments in machine learning that might be useful or insightful to others

### Day-to-Day Work

As of May 2025, I'm currently working on:

- Machine learning and unlearning  
- Topics related to LLMs and transformers  
- Spatiotemporal data

### Skills

My skills include, but are not limited to: Python, PyTorch, data visualization, statistics and probability, Java EE, Spring, RDBMS, Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, networking, Arduino, server configuration, Linux, Docker, AWS, API development, Git, CI/CD, aspect-oriented programming, object-oriented programming, Eclipse IDEs, WordPress plugin development, and LLM-based application development.

Yes, that‚Äôs a lot of skills ü§Ø, but I'm not a master of all of them. I'm a master of none üòè, but a jack of all trades. I'm a fast learner and always eager to pick up new things by diving into documentation or code and figuring out how it all works. :))

### Open Source

I'm passionate about open-source! I've contributed to and developed projects, especially in machine learning and scientific programming. Always eager to collaborate‚Äîlet's build something great!

### Sports

I love going to the gym, swimming, and cycling.
