A Study of the Naming-Related Circuit <ul> <li> <strong>Abstract summary</strong>: A mechanistic interpretability paper that seeks to identify the specific neural circuit within a language model responsible for associating names with entities.</li> <li> <strong>Reason for inclusion</strong>: A prime example of mechanistic interpretability, digging deep into how a specific, fundamental capability is implemented in a model.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Language Models are Weak Agents, But Strong Tool Users <ul> <li> <strong>Abstract summary</strong>: This paper likely presents a study arguing that the main power of LLM-based agents comes not from their innate planning abilities, but from their effective use of external tools.</li> <li> <strong>Reason for inclusion</strong>: Offers a clear and potentially influential perspective on the architecture and capabilities of agents built on foundational models.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Understanding and Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models <ul> <li> <strong>Abstract summary</strong>: This work provides an analysis of why multimodal vision-language models hallucinate facts and proposes methods to reduce this behavior.</li> <li> <strong>Reason for inclusion</strong>: Addresses a critical failure mode (hallucination) in foundational models, which is essential for building reliable systems.</li> </ul> </li> <li>World Model on Million-Length Video and Language <ul> <li> <strong>Abstract summary</strong>: Describes the creation of a “world model” trained on extremely long sequences of video and text, likely pushing the state-of-the-art in long-context modeling.</li> <li> <strong>Reason for inclusion</strong>: High-impact, large-scale work on generative and foundational models, tackling the frontier of long-sequence understanding.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The Sparse Transformer: A New Architecture for Language Modeling <ul> <li> <strong>Abstract summary</strong>: Proposes a new Transformer architecture based on sparse connectivity patterns, likely aiming for significantly improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.</li> <li> <strong>Reason for inclusion</strong>: Potential for a foundational architectural innovation that could influence the next generation of LLMs.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h2 id="why-use-ai-to-curate">Why Use AI to Curate?</h2> <p>Because even experts can’t read everything, and sometimes it helps to bring a fresh (or weird) lens. You might disagree with some of the picks. That’s great. Use this list as a <em>conversation starter</em>, not a verdict. What would your top 10 look like? Which of these would <em>you</em> bet on becoming influential a year from now?</p> <h2 id="-so-which-one-should-you-read">🤷 So… Which One Should You Read?</h2> <p>Honestly? I don’t know yet. That’s the point. Some of these may be overhyped. Others might be quiet classics. But all of them <em>seem</em> to reach beyond the incremental. As the full papers come out and people dig into the math, we’ll see which ones hold up, and which ones quietly change the way we think. In general, one good heuristic is always to look into papers that you <strong>know their author/lab</strong> that are well-known researchers, which we haven’t done here. You can also follow your favourite researcher to see their tweets about their paper 😉. But I think this list is a good starting point to find some hidden gems.</p> <h2 id="-whats-next">🧭 What’s Next?</h2> <p>I’d love to do follow-ups:</p> <ul> <li>A deep dive into the <strong>most cited</strong> vs. <strong>least cited</strong> of these picks in six months</li> <li>A themed breakdown: <em>top picks in interpretability</em>, <em>causality</em>, <em>generative models</em>, etc.</li> <li>A comparison between <strong>Gemini-selected vs. community-selected</strong> papers But for now, here’s the bet: <strong>At least a few of these 50 will turn out to matter more than their titles suggest.</strong> </li> </ul> <h2 id="my-thought">My thought</h2> <p>I don’t know which of these papers are truly important, or not. But the fact that Gemini selected them shows one thing clearly: it’s judging based only on titles. So if we build research agents (or LLM-based search engines), they might prefer such papers, and that could lead to them being cited more frequently. (You get the idea.) So I’m not even sure that citation count is a reliable metric for comparison later on. Anyway, that’s my final note. If you find one you love, or one you hate, drop me a note.</p> <p>This Disclaimer is clear but I have to put it anyways.</p> <div style="border-left: 4px solid rgb(232, 38, 125); padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9; margin: 20px 0;"> <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This list is not endorsed by Gemini team or Google. It is a generated result of a prompt by Gemini 2.5 Pro. </div> <h2 id="a-surprise-at-the-end">A Surprise at the end</h2> <p>The papers without links are the ones I couldn’t find in the official ICML 2025 listings. I even searched for a few of them, turns out, they’re not real papers at all. Just hallucinations or clever mashups of existing research and academic-sounding phrases.</p> <p>So hey, pick a title and write your own paper, Gemini might just love it. 😂</p> <p>PS: My Prompt was:</p> <pre><code class="language-plain">You are an expert machine learning researcher and assistant. Your task is to select the 50 most relevant papers from the ICML 2025 conference, based on a provided list of paper titles and relative URLs (e.g., "/virtual/2025/poster/44561").

Each item is an HTML list entry:
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/virtual/2025/poster/44561"&gt;Strategy Coopetition Explains the Emergence and Transience of In-Context Learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

### My goals:
- Select 50 papers from ~3000 entries
- Prioritize high-quality, novel, and relevant research
- I’m particularly interested in the following topics: Foundation models, interpretability, generative models.
- Papers should be:
  - Innovative or influential
  - Related to the above topics or clearly high-impact
  - Either theoretically foundational or practically useful

### What you should do:
1. **Extract** the paper title and full URL (prepend "https://icml.cc" to the relative URL)
2. **Visit each paper’s ICML page**, if accessible, and extract:
   - The abstract
   - Authors
   - Any listed keywords or presentation format (e.g., spotlight/oral)
3. **Score each paper** based on:
   - Relevance to the topics I care about
   - Novelty and clarity of the abstract
   - Expected impact (e.g., new benchmarks, theory, or trends)
4. **Select the top 50 papers**
5. **Output** your result in the following format:
```

1. [Paper Title](https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/44561)

   * Abstract summary (1–2 lines)
   * Reason for inclusion (e.g., topic fit, novelty, etc.)

```

Only output the final selected list of 50 papers — do not explain your methodology unless asked.

I am attaching the list of papers in a .txt file, read all of the papers from that.
