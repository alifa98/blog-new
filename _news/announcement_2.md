I have been meaning to update my blog for a while now, and I finally got around to it! I have switched to a new Jekyll template that I really like, and I have also gone through and cleaned up some of the old posts.

The new template is meant to be more modern and visually appealing, also it had some portfolio features that I removed, I might add them back in the future.

Let me know what you think of the new theme! I am always open to feedback and suggestions.
